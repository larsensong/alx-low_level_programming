List of Tasks:

0. memset
File : 0-memset.c
Required : A function that fills memory with a constant byte.
Expected Results:
The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b.
Returns a pointer to the memory area s.

1. memcpy
File : 1-memcpy.c
Required : A function that copies memory area.
Expected Results :
The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest.
Returns a pointer to dest.

2. strchr
File : 2-strchr.c
Required : A function that locates a character in a string.
Expected Results : Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found

3. strspn
File : 3-strspn.c
Required : A function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
Expected Results : Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept

4. strpbrk
File : 4-strpbrk.c
Required : A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
Expected Results :
The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept.
Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found

5. strstr
File : 5-strstr.c
Required : A function that locates a substring.
Expected Results :
The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack.
The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared.
Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.

6. Chess is mental torture
File : 7-print_chessboard.c
Required : A function that prints the chessboard.
üí¨ Quote : ‚ÄúChess is mental torture‚Äù is what Garry Kasparov said in the context of his 1990s match vs Nigel Short.


7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire
File : 8-print_diagsums.c
Required : A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
Note :
The following example we are casting an int[][] into an int.*
This is not something you should do.
The goal here is to make sure you understand how an array of array is stored in memory.

8. Double pointer, double fun
File : 100-set_string.c
Required : A function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
